# Explain how k8s external secret work with aws secret manager
- External Secrets is a Kubernetes operator that integrates with external secret management systems, such as AWS Secrets Manager, to securely retrieve and inject secrets into Kubernetes pods. It provides a seamless way to manage secrets stored outside of Kubernetes, reducing the complexity and risk associated with managing secrets within the cluster.

  - Here's a step-by-step explanation of how External Secrets works with AWS Secrets Manager, including installation and an example:

# Install External Secrets:

- To use External Secrets, you need to install the External Secrets controller on your Kubernetes cluster. You can install it using YAML manifests or Helm charts provided by the External Secrets project.

# Create an AWS Secret Manager secret:

  - In AWS Secrets Manager, create a secret that contains the sensitive data you want to manage. For example, let's create a secret named "my-secret"  with two key-value pairs: "username" and "password".

# Create an External Secret resource:

  - In Kubernetes, create an External Secret resource that references the AWS Secrets Manager secret. The External Secret resource acts as a bridge between Kubernetes and the external secret management system.
Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: 'kubernetes-client.io/v1'
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: my-external-secret
spec:
  backendType: secretsManager
  data:
    - key: my-secret
      name: my-external-secret-data
```      
- In this example, the backendType is set to secretsManager to indicate that the secret is stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The data section specifies the key-value pair mapping between the Kubernetes secret and the AWS Secrets Manager secret.

# Create a Kubernetes Secret:

- Kubernetes requires a Secret resource to store the retrieved secret data from AWS Secrets Manager. Create a Kubernetes Secret that matches the External Secret resource defined in the previous step.
Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-external-secret-data
```  
- This creates an empty Kubernetes Secret with the same name as specified in the name field of the External Secret resource.

# External Secrets Controller fetches the secret:

- The External Secrets controller periodically reconciles the External Secret resource and communicates with the AWS Secrets Manager API to retrieve the secret data.
Once fetched, the External Secrets controller updates the corresponding Kubernetes Secret with the retrieved data.

# Inject the secret into a pod:

- In your application deployment manifest, reference the Kubernetes Secret to inject the secret data into your pod's environment variables, volume mounts, or other configurations.
Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-app-image
          env:
            - name: MY_USERNAME
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-external-secret-data
                  key: username
            - name: MY_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: my-external-secret-data
                  key: password
```                  
- In this example, the env section specifies environment variables that retrieve values from the Kubernetes Secret using the secretKeyRef reference.
By following these steps, External Secrets integrates with AWS Secrets Manager to securely retrieve and inject the secret data into your Kubernetes pods. This allows you to centralize the management of sensitive data in external secret management systems while leveraging Kubernetes to handle the deployment and lifecycle management of your applications.

# What is external-secret wehbook

- In Kubernetes, a webhook is an HTTP callback mechanism that allows external systems or services to intercept and modify the behavior of API requests sent to the Kubernetes API server. Webhooks enable you to extend and customize the behavior of Kubernetes without modifying the core codebase.

- When an application like External-Secret needs a webhook, it typically refers to an admission webhook. Admission webhooks are a type of Kubernetes webhook that intercepts and validates API requests to the Kubernetes API server before they are persisted. They allow you to enforce custom admission policies or perform additional actions on the API requests.

- External-Secret is an application that enables you to store and retrieve secrets from external secret management systems, such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault, and make them available as Kubernetes Secrets. It uses an admission webhook to intercept requests to create or update Secret objects in Kubernetes.

# Here's how External-Secret's webhook works:

- Webhooks, such as the admission webhook used by External-Secret, provide a powerful mechanism to extend Kubernetes and implement custom logic and policies for handling API requests. They enable you to integrate external services and perform actions based on specific events or conditions, enhancing the functionality and security of your Kubernetes cluster.

  - When you create or update a Secret object in Kubernetes, the request is sent to the Kubernetes API server.
  - The admission webhook configured by External-Secret intercepts the request before it is persisted.
  - The webhook validates the request and performs actions to retrieve the secret data from the external secret management system.
  - The secret data is then stored in the Kubernetes Secret object, making it available for use by other Kubernetes resources.
  - The modified request is sent back to the Kubernetes API server, which persists the Secret object with the retrieved secret data.
  - By using a webhook, External-Secret ensures that secret data from external systems is securely and dynamically fetched and stored in Kubernetes Secrets. 
  - It allows you to centralize secret management and integrate with various external secret providers while still leveraging the native Kubernetes Secret resource.
